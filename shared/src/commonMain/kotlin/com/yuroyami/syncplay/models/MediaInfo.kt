 *                                  MediaInfo parser class
 * This class is responsible for reading and parsing the media information of a video/audio
 * file. What it simply does is read all track information which exist within the file without
 * the need for external native C++ libraries. Instead, we use ExoPlayer's format metadata
 * classes and put it to use to parse a full MediaInfo-like information chart for our video.
